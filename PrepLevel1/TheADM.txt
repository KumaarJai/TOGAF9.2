The ADM : Architecture Development Model has 8 phases

Phase A: Vision

Phase B,C,D : Architecture of the 4 principal domains-
				B- Business
				D- Data
				A- Application
				T- Technology

Phase E,F : Planning, creating a roadmap towards achieving the architecture

Phase G: Implementation

Phase H: Chage Management

All phases A-H have a common activity called Requirement Management Phase Ongoing

Architecture Content Framework:

Artifacts: 
	Lists
	Matrices
	Diagrams

Deliverable: Contractually specified and in turn formally reviewed, agreed and signed off by the stakeholders

Building Block: 
	Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) : Named concepts that can be reused in multiple places.
	Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) : The implementations of the ABBs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Enterprise Continuum: A way to classify items in the architecture repository from extremly generic to extremenly specific. Usually represented as a line.


Foundation 		<-->  Common System		<--> Industry		  <--> Organization Specific 
Architecture  		  Architectures 		 Architectures		   Architectures


Foundation : Extremely Generic, applies to almost all systems

Common System :	Architecture which is generic at the same time a bit specific to the business domain.

Industry : Follows industry standards of data transfer/exchange. for example financial firms, educational firms, etc

Organization Specific : Properitory architecture, specific to an organization
